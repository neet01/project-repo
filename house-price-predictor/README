This C program calculates the price of a house using a one shot learning
algorithm. Once training data (test files attached show matrix dimenensions and proper weight values)
is fed, the program uses pseudo inverses and matrix multiplication to find the
weight of different features and ultimately apply a fitting price onto the house.

Weight Matrix : W = pseudoInv(X)*Y
  X = input data matrix
  Y = target vector
 
 Predicted Price : Y = W0 + W1*x1 + W2*X2 + W3*X3 + W4*X4
