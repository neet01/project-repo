This code calculates the price of a house by learing from
training data (test files attached show matrix dimenensions and proper weight values). 
It uses pseudo inverses along with matrix multiplication to find the
weight of different features and ultimately apply a proper price onto the house.

Weight Matrix : W = pseudoInv(X)*Y
  X = input data matrix
  Y = target vector
 
 Predicted Price : Y = W0 + W1*x1 + W2*X2 + W3*X3 + W4*X4
